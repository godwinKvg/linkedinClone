# linkedinClone

As You can see I'm making the Clone of Linkedin with Ionic
  
First of all I'll make the UI and then the backend with Firebase ( I do not want to make things complicated )

So As soon as I will finish the front I will publish it.

## Remerciements
Feel free to make suggestions
Thanks 

# Test it locally
git clone (gitlink)
npm install 
ionic serve
